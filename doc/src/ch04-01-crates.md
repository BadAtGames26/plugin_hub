# Crates

Crates are a library that gives us more functionality in Rust without needing to rewrite structuress and functions every time we make a new project. There are three primary crates we use in code modding:

### Unity
 
 This crate lets us interface with Il2Cpp with it's structures,

 ### Engage

 This crate lets us interface with Engage, accessing it's game data and internal processes.

 ### CobAPI

 This crate lets us interface with Cobalt, letting us add settings menus and triggering system events.
