This chapter covers concepts that are (mostly) specific to game modding and how they translate as Skyline plugins. You will be shown plugin templates documented examples to showcase the possibilities offered by the Skyline framework.

Cobalt specific concepts will be introduced in a later chapter once you're familiar with Skyline as a whole.
