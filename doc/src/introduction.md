# The Cobalt Plugin Book

This book assumes you're already familiar with [Cobalt](https://github.com/Raytwo/Cobalt) as a mod loader. See [the Wiki](https://github.com/Raytwo/Cobalt/wiki) for an overview of the features it offers.  

It is also highly recommended to know how to use a computer beyond opening your web browser. You **will** be expected to know how to use a terminal and this book will not teach you.  
You have been warned. 

You can contribute to this book on [GitHub](https://github.com/DivineDragonFanClub/plugin_hub/tree/master/doc) by submitting a Pull Request.

> **ðŸš¨ Cobalt and the best practices for plugin development are in a constant state of
> change and it is advised to revisit the book and examples semi-frequently to see if
> new approaches were introduced.**
